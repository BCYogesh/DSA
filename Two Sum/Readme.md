- Brute Force :
-
- Traverse the array
- I have a target right
- I have two loops
- one is pointing starting pos
- and another is pointng after one th pos
- Every time first loop passes i want change second loop pos
- and each second loop will be come
- i want check the condition i + j == target
- it will match target i want return the indices
- the indices will be i and j values
- if target does not matching anything return []
-
- Optimal Solution :
-
- I have traverse the array
- Each time we traverse the array we assign the value in map ds with keys
- And another have to traverse the array
- In this time have to substract to target - nums[i]
- Substracted value has there in the complement i want return the indices
- If no value is not matches i want return []
