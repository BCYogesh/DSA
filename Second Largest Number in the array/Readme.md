# Second Largest number in the array

- Ex: [3,6,12,2,5]

- First of all I want to show that how to find first largest element in the array.
- Then move on to second largest element in the array.
- let's initialize the value of firstLargest as -Infinity.
- And then loop through the array. If 3 > -Infinity then assign the values as 3 in firstLargest.
- Till the process the end of the array we will get the first largest element in the array.

- Now, use this logic to find how to get the second largest value in the array.
- Initially I have declared two variables.
- First variable as firstLargest and second as secondLargest. both are assigned as -Infinity.
- And then loop through the array. If 3 is more than -Infinity then assign the value as 3 in firstLargest
- Then move the second value as 6 > 3 is it true then assign the firstLargestvalue as 6 and before firstLargestValue as 3 that will be assign as secondLargestValue.
- Finally end of the array we will get the second largest element.
